# Generating Randomness
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/395cbde9-3379-4f9f-946d-34db65d19ba5)

The program starts by asking for 100 symbols: 1 or 0.
Then for keeping track of how accurate it was, it "gives" you $1000, it adds to it if it didn't guess correctly, and subtracts from it if it does.
So then it asks you to put in a random string: the first three characters are given to the AI to guess the remainder of what you entered.
The loop ends when you type "enough"
